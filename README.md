Assignment Requirements:

    Create a python project skeleton that contains functioning placeholders for key python project best-practice elements:
    .devcontainer : development container which normally contains a devcontainer.json and often a Dockerfile to ensure consistency, portability, and isolation for your projects development environment.
    Makefile (with commands for setup, testing, and linting): highly valuable tool for easy command line entries as well as CI/CD yaml commands.
    CI/CD: functioning CI/CD for setup, lint, test (with a badge on the readme)
    EADME.md with setup and usage instructions

Purpose:
    The purpose of this repo is to understand how to build the basis framework of a project and provide a template for future projects.
